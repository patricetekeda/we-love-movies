# WeLoveMovies

This project is from [Thinkful](https://www.thinkful.com/bootcamp/web-development/) and is designed to test the student's ability to both build complex servers and access data through a database. It is a REST API built using Node.js, Express.js and uses Knex.js to query a postgresql database.
